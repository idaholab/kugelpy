abstractNote = {Pebble-bed reactors (PBRs) rely on a continual feed of fuel pebbles being cycled through the core. As a result, they require a “run-in” period in order to reach an equilibrium state. The run-in period for a PBR is a complex, time-dependent problem that requires the injection of new fuel, different types of fuel, and power increases. This complexity in the run-in makes it important to capture the physical processes in order to generate an accurate representation. The present work details the creation of a high-fidelity Monte Carlo methodology for analyzing the run-in and subsequent approach to equilibrium for PBRs. The methodology entails a Python module wrapped around Serpent so as to perform neutronics calculations, move pebbles, refuel the core, and discharge pebbles, thereby modeling the explicit behavior of the PBR run-in. Further, three run-in simulations (a constant temperature profile, a linear temperature profile, and a constant temperature profile using control rods) were examined in order to identify the key physical phenomena present in the run-in process. Utilizing kugelpy, we found the inclusion of a temperature profile to be important for accurately capturing a discharge burnup (around 141 MWd/kg), a consistent k-eff (around 1.005), and an average pebble power (around 2.5 kW/pebble) that all fall within acceptable limits.},

abstract = {The Xe-100 is a high temperature, helium-cooled, graphite moderated, pebble bed reactor (HTGR) featuring a 6-times through, multi-pass (MEDUL = MEhrfachDUrchLauf) fuelling scheme. It is designed for delivering heat in the form of superheated steam at 565 °C and 16.5 MPa. This steam can be used to generate electricity, provide process heat for petrochemical application, or for cogeneration applications, such as the treatment of contaminated water resources, whilst simultaneously generating electricity. The design is characterized as a Generation IV reactor, with a core that cannot melt and featuring safety characteristics that will eliminate the need at any time to evacuate or displace the public, or that will cause unallowable contamination of the land. The technology is based on proven technology that has demonstrated these safety claims both experimentally and in commercial deployment. The foundation of proof ensures high levels of design and technical readiness. In the overview presented below a parametric comparison is offered of a 165 MWth design against that of X-energy’s 200 MWth reference Xe-100 design. The excess reactivity in both cases is shown to be limited by the continuous fuelling regime, whilst the core geometry and selected core power density enables passive heat removal. In this way the desired intrinsic safety design features of a typical GEN IV design are guaranteed. It is shown that even in the event of a depressurized loss of forced coolant (DLOFC) design basis event, no significant amount of radiological material will be released. A larger margin of tolerance is afforded in the 165 MWth design case, as expected. The coupled core neutronic and thermo-fluid dynamics design for the Xe-100 is performed with the VSOP-A and MGT systems of codes. For the equilibrium core, VSOP results demonstrate that the spherical fuel powers (maximum 3.0 kW) and operational temperatures (<1000 °C) fall well within the envelope of the design criteria. Adequate reactivity control and long-term, cold shutdown are provided by two separate, independently actuated systems, while the overall negative reactivity temperature coefficient is illustrated over the total operational range.}

title = {The importance of the AVR pebble-bed reactor for the future of nuclear power},
author = {Pohl, P},
abstractNote = {The AVR pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) at Juelich (Germany) operated from 1967 to 1988 and was certainly the most important HTGR project of the past. The reactor was the mass test bed for all development steps of HTGR pebble fuel. Some early fuel charges failed under high temperature conditions and contaminated the reactor. An accurate pebble measurement (Cs 137) allowed to clean the core from unwanted pebbles after 1981. The coolant activity went down and remained very low for the remaining reactor operation. A melt-wire experiment in 1986 revealed max. coolant temperatures of >1280 deg. C and fuel temperatures of >1350 deg. C, explained by under-estimated bypasses. The fuel still in the core achieved high burn-ups and showed under the extreme temperature conditions excellent fission product retention. Thus, the AVR operation qualified the HTGR fuel, and an average discharge burn-up of 112% fifa revealed an excellent fuel economy of the pebble-bed reactor. Furthermore, the AVR operation offers many meaningful data for code-to-experiment comparisons. (authors)},
